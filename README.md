## Google Cloud data engineering 

This repository contains various data engineering workflows code designed to automate tasks such as extracting data from Google Drive, uploading data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), running Dataproc workflows, and creating tables in BigQuery using Dataform. It also includes Airflow DAGs to orchestrate these processes.

### Main Services Used:
- **BigQuery**: Googleâ€™s fully managed data warehouse.
- **Airflow**: A platform for orchestrating complex workflows.
- **Dataform**: A tool to build scalable data workflows in BigQuery.
- **Dataproc**: A fully managed Spark and Hadoop service that allows you to run workflows efficiently.
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: A scalable and secure object storage service.
- **Google Drive**: A cloud storage service for extracting and storing files.
